# Vision
- Void Orcs! Half Nightstalker Half Tzeetch? I like the trope of [Gul'dan](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gul%27dan) Being al spooky and maybe not so good for the people he seeks to help. So like if Gul'dan ALSO turned his population into demon-nightmare things, etc. 
- Feel like an orc twlight kin or if RFO was void-y and not lightning-y
- Feels like a evil religion, very dark themes, but presented as a fervernt people that believe in their forces of the universe and cause. Dark paladins, warlocks, etc.
# Overview 
The members of the Shatterminds believe in the [[Shattered Realm]] and believe [[Narak]] will lead them to properly make pilgrimage and back from the [[Shattered Realm]] in pursuit of power and knowledge beyond what the [[Material Plain]] can give. Many members of the Shatterminds believe they have greater purpose and existence that can only be found in the [[Shattered Realm]] and conduct their life's work to reaching it to fulfill their destiny.
