Based on [[Class-Race Roll Table]]
Race: Tiefling
Class: Rouge
Subclass: ? 
Rouge feels laissez-faire, no real rule of law, just rule of "might". A bunch of white-collar families that shift power. Geographically I don't like it, but we could see how it could work. Very necromunda and each city seems to have the pull of gang cities. With no real centralization, each city could be owned by a different gang, almost like sub nations fighting with each other. How would they fend off other nations though? enemy of my enemy is my friend type stuff most likely. 

# Major Families
Each family encompasses different natures, and the main bloodline may be of the specific race, but they employ any who will help the family. The Vaulta's own the nations "capitol" while each of the others have their own major city.
