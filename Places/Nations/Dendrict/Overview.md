A very militant and martial nation. Proud of their heritage and have trained themselves for years to be a very capable opponent. Mostly isolationist, and specialize in defensive tactics. However, if an offensive campaign were to ever need to be employed again, they have a very entrenched style, taking inches from their enemy nations 1 day at a time. This nature is the only reason they have been able to survive being the isolated neighbor of [[Cepht]]. That plus a proud navy has allowed them to prosper given their relentless neighbors. Many wonder if the [[Cepht]] civil war is the prime time for Dendrict to strike out against it's enemy.
